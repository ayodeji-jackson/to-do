- [@react-native-voice/voice](https://github.com/react-native-voice/voice) for converting speech to text, it utilizes the speech to text software of the device's operating system, chosen because its apis are simple and the package is well maintained. 
- for natural language processing, i went with [compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) because it's very lightweight and very popular. it failed to break the simple clauses joined together by the 'and' conjuction into individual sentences; a small heuristic function which can be found in `utils.ts` complements compromise for this purpose
